# DataWizard — ML made simple

Welcome to the DataWizard course materials. This site will host short, focused notebooks and pages that follow the curriculum in `Carriculum.md`.

Start here:

- [Python basics](python-basics)
- [Curriculum](../Carriculum.md)

This book uses MathJax for rendering math. You can author math inline with $...$ or as display math with $$...$$. Labeled equations use the MyST `{math}` directive.
